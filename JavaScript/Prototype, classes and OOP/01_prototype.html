    <h1>Prototype in Javascript</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, every object has a hidden property called [[Prototype]] (you can see it via __proto__), which refers to another object. That "other object" acts as a blueprint from which properties and methods can be inherited.
It’s like:
“If I don’t have this method, let me ask my prototype (my parent).”</p>
