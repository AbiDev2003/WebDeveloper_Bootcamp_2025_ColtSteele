    <h1>OOP in JavaScript</h1>
    <h1>Hello !</h1>
    <p>OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects” — which can contain data (properties) and behavior (methods). It's like modeling real-world entities in code — making your programs more organized, reusable, and easier to manage.</p>
    <p>OOP in JS Can Be Done In Two Ways: <br>
        1. Prototype-based (older style) <br>
        2. Class-based (modern ES6+ style) ← most common now
