# React Learning Guide (Using CodeSandbox)

## 🚀 Introduction

We are starting our React journey using **[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)** — an online code editor tailored for modern web development. It's fast, beginner-friendly, and doesn’t require any local setup. 

Later, we will transition to **VS Code** for a more customizable development environment.

## ✅ What's Next?

Once we are comfortable with the basics of React using CodeSandbox, we will:

- Learn how project structure works locally
- Use Git and GitHub for version control
